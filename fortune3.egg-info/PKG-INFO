Description: 
        Introduction
        ============
        
        ``fortune`` is a stripped-down implementation of the classic BSD Unix
        ``fortune`` command. It combines the capabilities of the ``strfile`` command
        (which produces the fortune index file) and the ``fortune`` command (which
        displays a random fortune). It reads the traditional ``fortune`` program's
        text file format.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Usage::
        
            fortune [OPTIONS] /path/to/fortunes
        
            OPTIONS
        
            -h, --help      Show usage and exit.
            -u, --update    Update the index file.
            -q, --quiet     When updating the index file, do so quietly.
            -V, --version   Show version and exit.
        
        If you omit the path, ``fortune`` looks at the ``FORTUNE_FILE`` environment
        variable. If that environment variable isn't set, ``fortune`` aborts.
        
        Fortune Cookie File Format
        ==========================
        
        A fortune cookie file is a text file full of quotes. The format is simple:
        The file consists of paragraphs separated by lines containing a single '%'
        character. For example::
        
            A little caution outflanks a large cavalry.
                -- Bismarck
            %
            A little retrospection shows that although many fine, useful software
            systems have been designed by committees and built as part of multipart
            projects, those software systems that have excited passionate fans are
            those that are the products of one or a few designing minds, great
            designers. Consider Unix, APL, Pascal, Modula, the Smalltalk interface,
            even Fortran; and contrast them with Cobol, PL/I, Algol, MVS/370, and
            MS-DOS.

        The Index File
        ==============
        
        For efficiency and speed, ``fortune`` uses an index file to store the offsets
        and lengths of every fortune in the text fortune file. So, before you can use
        ``fortune`` to read a random fortune, you have to generate the data file. With
        the traditional BSD ``fortune`` program, you used the I{strfile}(8) command
        to generate the index. With I{this} fortune program, however, you simply
        pass a special argument to the ``fortune`` command::
        
            fortune -u /path/to/fortunes
        
        That command will generate a binary ``/path/to/fortunes.dat`` file that
        contains the index. You should run ``fortune -u`` whenever you change the text
        fortune file.
        
        Generating a Random Fortune
        ===========================
        
        Once you have an index file, you can generate a random fortune simply by
        running the ``fortune`` utility with the path to your text fortunes file::
        
            fortune /path/to/fortunes
        
        Differences
        ===========
        
        This version of ``fortune`` does not provide some of the more advanced
        capabilities of the original BSD program. For instance, it lacks:
        
        - the ability to mark offensive and inoffensive fortunes
        - the ability to separate long and short quotes
        - the ability to print all fortunes matching a regular expression
        
        It does, however, provide the most important function: The ability to display
        a random quote from a set of quotes.
